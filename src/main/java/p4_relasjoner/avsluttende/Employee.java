/**
 * Implement a class that represents an employee in a company called Employee
 * 
 * The expected methods for this class and their behaviour is detailed
 * in the below JavaDoc
 * 
 * The Employee class must be in the package p4_relasjoner.avsluttende
 * 
 * The Employee class should NOT implement any interfaces.
 * 
 * This exercise tests knowledge from p1_intro_java, p2_intro_oop, p3_mer_om_java AND p4_relasjoner:
 * 
 * From p1_intro_java:
 * - Primitive data types (int, boolean, double, char)
 * - String operations (length, charAt, indexOf, toUpperCase, toLowerCase, equals, replace)
 * - Arrays (creation, access, length)
 * - Loops (for, for-each, while, if-else)
 * - Methods (parameters, return values, method overloading)
 * - Basic operators (+, -, *, /, %, ==, !=, &&, ||, !)
 * 
 * From p2_intro_oop:
 * - Classes and objects
 * - Constructors (with parameters, constructor overloading)
 * - Instance fields and methods
 * - Encapsulation (private fields, public methods)
 * - Input validation in constructors and setters
 * - Exception throwing (IllegalArgumentException, IllegalStateException)
 * - Static fields and methods
 * - The 'this' keyword
 * - toString() method overriding
 * 
 * From p3_mer_om_java:
 * - Collections (List, Map, Set, Queue)
 * - Wrapper classes (Integer, Double, Character, Boolean)
 * - Wrapper class methods (parseInt, parseDouble, isDigit, etc.)
 * - Object comparison (== vs equals)
 * - StringBuilder for efficient string building
 * - LocalDate for date handling
 * 
 * From p4_relasjoner:
 * - One-to-one associations (bidirectional relationships)
 * - One-to-many associations (bidirectional relationships)
 * - Many-to-many associations (bidirectional relationships)
 * - Hierarchical/recursive associations (parent-child relationships)
 * - Inheritance (extends keyword, super keyword)
 * - Method overriding (@Override annotation)
 * - Proper association management (maintaining bidirectional consistency)
 *
